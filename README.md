# CART-315-Prototype-2

This week, I'm exploring the gamepad and VBGs (Virtual Board Games)

I designed a board game that could be played virtually and I wanted to implement using a pass-and-play controller / hotseat method. 
I want to try to understand where players feel like they lose touch with playing board games virtually. I hope to understand what pushes 
a player to keep playing. I also want to know how people feel about local co-op play. I, personally find it really amusing!


I was pretty sick this past week and didn't have time to fully implement my game into Unity and only have some menus and code to show. 
Nevertheless, I think all ideas start somewhere and I can always use this week's playtesting session to test my other game prototype.
